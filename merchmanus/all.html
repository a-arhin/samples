		<p>Noissue creates custom branded packaging supplies for independent companies and artists. Their materials are all biodegradable and sustainably sourced, and if you join their Eco-Packaging Alliance, trees will be planted for every order you make. Noissue is a great choice if you want to reduce the amount of plastic used in your packaging.</p>
		<p>The unit prices for items such as the tissue paper and mailers are very low, but the minimum order quantities are pretty high if you're a small artist.</p>

		<p>Though the prices per sticker pack are reasonable, you can’t divide the order between multiple designs, which means you will end up with around 80+ stickers of the same design. This isn’t very practical for those just starting out, or who have a smaller audience.</p>

		<p>Vograce offers many different finishes and configurations for charms, including holographic, rainbow film, epoxy, and more, and you get to choose from a range of keyrings and attachments to further customize your charms. Charms from Vograce come fully assembled with keyrings attached, so there is no need to buy hardware yourself.</p>
		<p>Items from Vograce are very affordable with no minimum order quantity, so you could order as few as one item. However, overseas shipping costs can be very high, and with the products being cheaply produced you run the risk of defective items. Additionally, some artists have reported having their designs stolen after working with this company.</p>

		<p>The acrylic used by Zap is made with recycled leftovers from previous production that would otherwise be sent to a landfill, the wood is sustainably sourced from responsibly managed woodlands, and the paper used for backing cards is recycled uncoated paper.</p>
		<p>*Normally, Zap’s acrylic charms don’t come with hardware; you would have to buy any rings and attachments offsite. If you buy the Keyring option rather than the Charm option, you get a metal ring attached with a rubber clip. You get to choose the color of the rubber, but that’s as far as the customization goes.</p>
