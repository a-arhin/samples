		<p>Vograce offers many different finishes and configurations for charms, including holographic, rainbow film, epoxy, and more, and you get to choose from a range of keyrings and attachments to further customize your charms. Charms from Vograce come fully assembled with keyrings attached, so there is no need to buy hardware yourself.</p>
		<p>Items from Vograce are very affordable with no minimum order quantity, so you could order as few as one item. However, overseas shipping costs can be very high, and with the products being cheaply produced you run the risk of defective items. Additionally, some artists have reported having their designs stolen after working with this company.</p>

		<p>The acrylic used by Zap is made with recycled leftovers from previous production that would otherwise be sent to a landfill, the wood is sustainably sourced from responsibly managed woodlands, and the paper used for backing cards is recycled uncoated paper.</p>
		<p>*Normally, Zap’s acrylic charms don’t come with hardware; you would have to buy any rings and attachments offsite. If you buy the Keyring option rather than the Charm option, you get a metal ring attached with a rubber clip. You get to choose the color of the rubber, but that’s as far as the customization goes.</p>
