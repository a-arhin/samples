		<h2>About MerchManus</h2>
		<p class="desc">When I was first looking into starting an online merch store back in early 2019, I had <em>such</em> a hard time finding manufacturers. I’d spend hours researching and comparing and getting frustrated that there wasn’t an easier way. This site is essentially what I wished I had at the time&#8212;a directory of resources for artists who want to create merch that serves as an easy place to find and compare manufacturers without having to scour the internet. I hope that it can save another artist some time and energy.</p>
